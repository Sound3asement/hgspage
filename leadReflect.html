  <h3>Trust</h3>
  <img class="reflectImg"src="trust.jpeg" alt="">
  <p>It is very hard for me to build trust in these recent months because before I have been too trusting and it ended up getting broken.  Before I used to trust most people because I wanted them to trust me yk.  Now it takes more time because I need people to prove that i can trust them without them knowing thats what im looking for.  If they went out of their way to make it seem like I can trust them then there's no point in trusting them because how do i know if they are being fake or not?</p>

  <h3>The Importance of Gaming </h3>
  <img class="reflectImg2"src="gAming.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Today we talked about things about gaming like how it can be addictive and how to use moderation. A lot of people added that as long ad you have self control and you check the time or something then you should be okay.  We also talk a lot about the difference of spending 6 hours on a game and 6 hours doing something else like homework or coding. And the main difference we came  to is productivity. I also heard conversation about reward and the feeling of success and completion when your playing a game, as well as the drive of competitive spirit. </p>

Shortcuts are when you use the command or control button to do something faster than usual. A common shortcut is copy and paste, everyone knows what cmd + c and cmd + v do. Bash commands do similar things to shortcuts but they are in the computers terminal. these commands do things like find a folder or close a window. </p>
