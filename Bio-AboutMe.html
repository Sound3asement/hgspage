  <p class="AboutMe"><em>Learn more about me:</em> <br>
    I am a 15 year old Sophmore at Saint Mary's College High School.
    <br> I play Soccer and Basketball as well as Run Track.
    <br> I like Video games and Music Production.
    <br> When I go to college I want to study Music Production and Sound Engineering.
    <br> I live in San Ramon California with my Mom and My Sister.
    <br> I love arguments and back and forth conversations because its an oppertunity for me to grow, even if the other doesn't.
